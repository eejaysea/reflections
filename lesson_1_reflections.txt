How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    With a big file it was easy to go through just the parts that had changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Improve your coding style throughout the versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually gives you more control, automatically is more of a safety net

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programming often requires updating multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show you commits and the id and a comment about the commits. git diff will let you see what changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    being able to easily roll back to a state that was working

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    duh! programming you filth!
